# CSGO Surf Load Screens
 Collection of load screen images for CSGO surf maps in .dds format. 


## How was this made, and why is that important?

This project was a rather quick bulk conversion of my main [SurfMapPics Project](https://github.com/Sayt123/SurfMapPics). 

The images were scaled to 1024px height, then bulk cropped relatively towards the center to bring the images to 1024x1024 before being exported. Why is this important? Well some images might have some weird angles or be too cramped up against a ramp etc. Please let me know if you find any of these images and I can tweak them.

## How to use:

Normal people/clients that just want to have ALL the load screens installed:

Download this repo, place all the .dds image files into your csgo installation in **../csgo/resource/overlays/** and you're good to go!
